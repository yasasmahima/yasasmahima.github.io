#### Research Activities

As autonomous and unmanned vehicles increasingly use artificial intelligence, new research challenges arise. My current
research primarily focuses on addressing the robustness of computer vision systems and the development of AI-driven
solutions for autonomous and unmanned vehicles. Furthermore, I investigate advanced AI applications in the domains of
smart cities,
public health, and safety.

#### Biography

I am a third-year PhD candidate in the School of Engineering Technology at
the <a href="https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/seit">University of New South Wales (UNSW)</a>, Canberra, ACT, Australia.
During my PhD, I worked as a Research Consultant in AI and Computer Vision at the <a href="https://www.unisq.edu.au/">
University of Southern Queensland</a>, Brisbane, Australia, on a project in collaboration with the Robotic and
Autonomous Systems Implementation & Coordination Office (RICO) of the Australian Army.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant in computer vision, drones, multispectral image processing,
and mmWave radar at the <a href="https://ucsc.cmb.ac.lk">University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC)</a>, in
collaboration with <a href="https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se">DigitalFutures</a> by KTH, RISE, and Uppsala University,
Sweden.

Additionally, I was employed by the <a href="https://www.iit.ac.lk">Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT)</a>, Sri
Lanka, as a visiting lecturer. There, I taught object-oriented programming and advanced database systems to University
of Westminster undergraduates and supervised several undergraduate research projects.

I earned my BEng (Hons) in Software Engineering from the <a href="https://www.westminster.ac.uk">University of
Westminster</a>, UK, affiliated with IIT Sri Lanka. There, I achieved the gold medal for academic excellence (batch top)
and the Best Final Year Research Project award. My undergraduate work has been recognized at prestigious events such
as <a href="https://cuttingedge.iit.ac.lk">IIT Cutting Edge</a> and <a href="https://nbqsa.com">NBQSA National ICT
Awards</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Trainee Associate Data Engineer
at <a href="https://zone24x7.com">Zone24x7 Inc.</a>, an Undergraduate Research Fellow at
the <a href="http://sead.open.ac.uk">SEAD Lab</a>, The Open University, UK, and a Trainee Associate Software Engineer
at <a href="https://www.revportx.com/index.html">RevportX</a>.
