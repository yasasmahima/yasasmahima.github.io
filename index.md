#### Research Activities

As autonomous and unmanned vehicular systems employ artificial intelligence, novel open research problems are raised. My current research interests mainly include the robustness of artificial intelligence systems deployed in autonomous and unmanned vehicles. Apart from that, I also investigate novel AI applications for smart cities, public health and safety. 


#### Biography

I am an upcoming PhD candidate in the School of Engineering & Information Technology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Canberra ACT, Australia. At present, I am working as a research assistant in computer vision, drones, multispectral image processing and mmWave radar at the <a href="#"> University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) </a> collaborated with DigitailFutures by KTH, RISE and Uppsala University Sweden. 

Additionally, I am employed by the <a href="#">Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) </a>, Sri Lanka, as a visiting lecturer. There, I have been teaching object-oriented programming and advanced database systems for the University of Westminster undergraduates and as well as I am co-supervising several undergraduate research projects.

I earned my BEng (Hons) in Software Engineering from the University of Westminster, UK affiliated with IIT Sri Lanka. There I was able to achieve the gold medal for academic excellence (batch top) and the best final year research project awards. My undergraduate works have been recognized at prestigious events such as IIT Cutting Edge and NBQSA National ICT Awards. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a trainee associate data engineer at Zone24x7 Inc. and an undergraduate research fellow at the SEAD lab, The Open University, UK. 



<!-- I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://fcrlab.unime.it/">Future Computing Research Laboratory</a> at the Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Hearth Sciences of the <a href="https://international.unime.it/">University of Messina</a>. I was research fellow in the same university and I earned my Ph.D. in the Department of Engineering at <a href="https://www.unirc.it/en/">University of Reggio Calabria</a> in May 2020 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12645423500">Massimo Villari</a>.

I led activities related to the technical area for the EU project "FLIWARE" and the Italian FISR "Re-functionalization of the Contemporary". From 2018 to 2020, I worked as software developer of <a href="https://humanizing.com/en/">Humanizing Technologies GmbH</a> in Vienna, one of the most appreciated suppliers of non-industrial robots and robot software worldwide. From 2020, I am an <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/44cecf40-460e-4730-aa49-79733224134e/public_url">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a>. From 2021, I am authorized to practice as Information Engineer (Italy, Section A).

I have been teacher of several subjects, among which Computer Networks and Algorithms, and teacher's guide of Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence. I am reviewer of respected Springer, IEEE and Elsevier Journals, member of the <a href="http://www.ifiptc12.org/component/tags/tag/41-wg-12-9">IFIP Working Group 12.9 about Computational Intelligence</a>, co-chairs of IEEE Workshops (<a href="https://fcrlab.unime.it/calls/distinsys2022">DistInSys</a>, <a href="https://fcrlab.unime.it/calls/mriche2021">MrICHE</a>, and <a href="https://www.ai4health.icar.cnr.it/">AI4Health</a>) and co-author of more than 30 manuscripts. -->
