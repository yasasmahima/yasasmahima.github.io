#### Research Activities

As autonomous and unmanned vehicular systems employ artificial intelligence, novel open research problems are raised. My current research interests mainly include the robustness of artificial intelligence systems deployed in autonomous and unmanned vehicles. Apart from that, I also investigate novel AI applications for smart cities, public health and safety. 


#### Biography

I am a first year PhD candidate in the School of Engineering & Information Technology at the <a href="https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/seit"> University of New South Wales (UNSW) </a>, Canberra ACT, Australia. Prior to that, I worked as a research assistant in computer vision, drones, multispectral image processing and mmWave radar at the <a href="https://ucsc.cmb.ac.lk"> University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) </a> collaborated with <a href="https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se">DigitalFutures</a> by KTH, RISE and Uppsala University Sweden. 

Additionally, I was employed by the <a href="https://www.iit.ac.lk">Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) </a>, Sri Lanka, as a visiting lecturer. There, I taught object-oriented programming and advanced database systems for the University of Westminster undergraduates as well as I co-supervised several undergraduate research projects. 

I earned my BEng (Hons) in Software Engineering from the <a href="https://www.westminster.ac.uk">University of Westminster </a>, UK affiliated with IIT Sri Lanka. There I was able to achieve the gold medal for academic excellence (batch top) and the best final year research project awards. My undergraduate works have been recognized at prestigious events such as <a href="https://cuttingedge.iit.ac.lk">IIT Cutting Edge</a> and <a href="https://nbqsa.com">NBQSA National ICT Awards </a>. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a trainee associate data engineer at <a href="https://zone24x7.com">Zone24x7 Inc. </a> and an undergraduate research fellow at the <a href="http://sead.open.ac.uk">SEAD lab</a>, The Open University, UK.
